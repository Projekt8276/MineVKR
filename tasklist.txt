1. Try just modify exist...

Possible solutions... 
- https://github.com/jpbruyere/vkvg (require Linux)
- https://github.com/nyorain/rvg (require Linux)

2. Search or write dependencies...

Possible solutions... 

For C++ way
- https://github.com/delfrrr/delaunator-cpp
- https://github.com/I3ck/lib_2d 
- https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp
- https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp
- https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator
- https://github.com/svgpp/svgpp

For Rust way
- https://github.com/nical/lyon
- https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano
- https://github.com/gwihlidal/vk-mem-rs
- https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash

For Node.JS way
- https://github.com/mattdesl/shape2d-triangulate
- https://github.com/mattdesl/fontpath-shape2d
- https://github.com/maierfelix/nvk
- (no memory allocator currently)

3. Write vector graphics with ray-tracing itself 
- [ ] Renderer with computing...
- [ ] RTX ON?
- [ ] How it fast?
- [ ] Write test suite!

Write effects, such as...
- [ ] Write bit stress example
- [ ] Local vector scaling demo
- [ ] Aero blur effect

Also, add in future features, like...
- [ ] DLSS
- [ ] Denoiser

4. Propose to Direct2D competition (in far future)
5. Write simple GUI with simple application, based in that library!
