## Planned... 

I planned to use Kotlin wrappers around `JavaCPP` classes (based on Java), because Kotlin supports operator overloading, but doesn't support `JavaCPP` directly... 
So, we will have three levels of wrapping and interfaces... 

Yes, `JavaCPP` can interact with Minecraft mod, but with indirection through neighbor classes (i.e. different types)... It means, `JavaCPP` and `Mixin` NOT are one class, but connected...
