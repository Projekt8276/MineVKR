## Other Developers

Any developer with knowledge of C, C ++, Java, as well as GLSL and EVEN HLSL (the most important thing is knowledge of the Vulkan API and OpenGL), can develop this mod with me. At the moment, we need additional strength and consultants in this matter ...


### About Minecraft Mod Idea... 

- Vulkan API can import OpenGL buffer data only using copy, OpenGL can import memory directly from Vulkan API. 
- Minecraft can use Vulkan API using JNI, JavaCPP, LWJGL-3... 
- Always communication using LONG type in Java and uint64_t in C++ 
- Java may have resolve conflicts with `VkDeviceOrHostAddressKHR` or `VkDeviceOrHostAddressConstKHR` due same LONG type... 
- Any native pointers in Java are LONG type...
